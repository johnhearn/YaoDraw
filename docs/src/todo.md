Currently YaoDraw only supports a small subset of the features of Yao.jl. These are some of the fundamental pieces that are missing:

- Initial state is currently always $|0..0\rangle$
- Angles are not displayed on rotation gates
- Most gates don't have a nice way of converting them to text
- Width of output image is constant
- Width of individual gates doesn't automatically accommodate text
- Doesn't support controlled blocks other than the simple gates
- Doesn't support measurements
- ...many more...
